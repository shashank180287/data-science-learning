# Espresso Python Training - Session 1
This is the material for the Python Espresso session.


 
## Folder structure
* The source code goes in the `<src>` folder, the data is in the `<data>` folder, the tests go in the `<test>` folder
* within `<src>` we will have a separate package (folder) for each problem we will tackle. E.g. data manipulation is in `<datamanipulation>`



## Session Agenda
This session is structured as a mini-hackathon. There will be a short Python introduction by the facilitators,
who will cover key Python concepts, followed by hands-on hacking.

Session Split:
* 15 min introduction and key Python concepts
* 60 min hacking
* 10-15 min Q&A

For the hacking session, please implement the following tasks:
1. Create a virtual environment with the Python interpreter
2. Complete all of the tasks in the files `src/datamanipulation/airline_manipulation` and `src/datamanipulation/data_preprocessing`
3. In `tests/test_data_manipulation.py`, write unit tests to the code in data_preprocessing 
4. Debug through a function
5. Initialise a logger and insert logging into the code
6. Ensure you have appropriate error handling for your code
7. Do some plotting by writing appropriate code in `src/plotting/data_visualisation`

[Optional] - for those who finish all the points above:
7. Write a function decorator that logs how long a function took to run

## Usage
Just unzip the code and use.
